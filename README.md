# Uninformed Search Algorithms

> This repository was an assignment for the course ***CSDS3203  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence***

This repository contains implementations and performance comparisons of classic **uninformed search algorithms**—**BFS**, **DFS**, **DLS**, and **DFID**—applied to two foundational AI problems:

- 🧩 The **8-Puzzle Problem**
- 🗺️ **Pathfinding in Undirected Graphs**

> Solved by: [*JaberAlJ*](https://github.com/JaberAlJ)

## 📌 Objectives

- Implement the core components of uninformed search techniques.
- Apply them to solve the 8-puzzle and pathfinding problems.
- Compare BFS, DFS, DLS, and DFID in terms of performance and optimality.
- Develop hands-on understanding through structured activities.

## 🧩 8-Puzzle Problem

A sliding puzzle consisting of a 3×3 board with one empty tile. The goal is to reach a target configuration.

## 🗺️ Graph Pathfinding

Implemented pathfinding algorithms on undirected graphs such as `tinyG.txt` and `mediumG.txt`.
